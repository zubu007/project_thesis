###### Spectrum of casting processes

 Casting of a ship's propeller, Mecklenburger Metallguss GmbH Robot-based manipulation and measurement of a light metal die-cast component, BMW AG

 − Wide range of different casting processes and associated components (dimension, alloy, quantity)

 − On the one hand, manual casting processes for highly individualized components (quantities 1-10), on the other hand, highly automated casting processes for quantities > 1,000,000 components


-----

###### Necessary post-processing and quality assurance

 Machining and 3D component measurement of a ship's propeller, Mecklenburger Metallguss GmbH

 − The production of cast components is a complex process that goes beyond simply casting the material

 − Post-processing and quality assurance processes are crucial to ensure the functionality and reliability of the cast components and to meet the required standards of the industry or end customers

 ➢ Machining: Usually necessary to achieve the required tolerances or surface finishes

 ➢ Heat treatment: Improves the mechanical properties of the workpiece, such as hardness and toughness, but also serves to
 homogenize material properties

 ➢ Quality assurance: A variety of test procedures to ensure that the component meets the specifications, e.g. 3D component


-----

###### Example of the use of different manufacturing processes for cast components

 − In relation to the realization of a cast component, processes of different main groups (“Hauptgruppen”, HG) of production technology according to DIN 8580 are often used:

 ➢ HG1: Primary shaping (→ Casting process)

 ➢ HG6: Change material properties (→ Heat
 treatment of the component)

 ➢ HG3: Cutting (→ Machining/final contouring of the
 component)

 ➢ HG5: Coating (→ Decorative painting of the
 component, anti-corrosion coatings)

Powder coating of the rim

###### ➢ HG4: Joining (→ Creating a welded assembly,
 screwing, bonding)

###### Comparison of material utilization and energy efficiency

 − Material utilization and energy efficiency are key aspects when selecting manufacturing processes, especially for large quantities

 − Material utilization: Generally high material utilization, as the material is poured in liquid/partially liquid form into a near-net-shape mold → complex geometries can be produced using as little material as possible

 − Casting processes are in contrast to ablative processes such as milling, where a large proportion of the raw material ends up as chips or waste

 − Energy efficiency: on the one hand, the melting of metals is energy-intensive; on the other hand, the direct production of complex parts in a single step can enable energy savings compared to multi-stage manufacturing processes

 − Solidification of the alloy in the mold

 − Required demolding from the surrounding mold

 − Visualization of mold filling and solidification of the filled melt

 − After completion of mold filling, both the temperature and the volume fraction of the melt (fLiquid) decrease

###### Schematic structures of liquids: metal, ceramic glass and thermoplastic polymer

 Initial state of liquid metals:

 − Molten metals are composed of a disorganized array of spherical atoms in thermal motion

 − Both attractive and repulsive interactions between adjacent atoms, as in solids, but interatomic separations are larger than in solids and the interactions weaker

 − The attractive interactions that hold the liquid together are mainly electrostatic, similar to those in solid metals

 − The ion cores of metallic atoms are attracted to the surrounding sea of electrons

 − Metal alloys, which are composed of more than one type of metal atom, have more complex structures and interatomic bonds


###### The schematics are not to-scale and include more free space than would be present in the real liquids!


###### − Clusters of atoms may form in the liquid state

###### − The ion cores of metallic atoms are attracted to the surrounding cloud of valence electrons

 − Molten metal structure and properties change with temperature

 − As the temperature is raised, atomic vibrations and motions increase, atoms are driven further apart and interatomic bonds weaken → the density of the melt drops consequently

 − In contrast, as the melt temperature decreases, the reverse occurs until the melt crystallizes and the atoms become locked into the regular crystal structure of the solid

###### Heat release during solidification

 − When a melt solidifies, the heat transport usually determines the speed of the process

 − During solidification, very large amounts of heat of fusion H (or here: L) are released, which must be dissipated

 − For materials at melting temperature, the heat of fusion typically reaches the same order of magnitude as the value of the integral cpdT

###### Process


###### Crystallization is a process in which atoms, molecules or ions are arranged in an ordered, solid structure that permeates the entire solid.


###### − Nucleation: First step in which small solid clusters are formed from the liquid; two types: homogeneous/heterogeneous

 − Crystal growth: Nucleation sites as the starting point for crystal growth; molecules arrange themselves on nuclei and form the specific pattern of the crystal

 − The rate of growth and thus crystal properties vary depending on the orientation of the crystal surface and are influenced by temperature, concentration and impurities

 − Interaction of crystal growth

 − Growing crystals can fuse when they meet others, reducing the number of crystals but increasing the size (known as coarsening or Ostwald ripening)

 − Process continues until the liquid is completely solidified or equilibrium i h d i h h lid ( i i )

###### Integration into a crystal lattice | long-range order

 − Temperature below melting point: The thermal movement of the individual atoms is so low that the mutual bonds can no longer be broken by vibrations


###### → Decrease in the kinetic energy of the atoms and binding to a stable and ordered crystal lattice

 − During integration into the crystal lattice, the electrons are separated from the atomic nucleus and collide with other atoms and electrons


###### − The latent heat refers to the energy released during the phase transition without changing the temperature

 − During crystal formation, diffusion processes occur continuously in which atoms in the molten state encounter an existing crystal lattice


###### Long-distance order: regular and continuous endless (into the distance) arrangement of molecules or atoms in a crystalline solid


###### Crystallization process at the atomic level:

 − Through diffusion processes, an atom in the molten state encounters the existing crystal lattice


###### − The electrons are separated from the atomic nucleus and collide with other atoms and electrons (→ latent heat) due to integration into the lattice (Long-distance order)

-----

###### Crystallization-free solidification

 − Kinematic inhibition of diffusion processes through rapid cooling → Atoms have too little kinetic energy due to the rapidly falling temperatures to reduce the distances to each other so much that crystallization can occur

 − If solidification is sufficiently rapid, the required maximum distances between the atoms are not reached

 − Electrons are not delocalized, i.e. they cannot dissipate energy through collisions as they are still bound to the atom

 − Without crystallization (= delocalization of the electrons) no latent heat and therefore no heat development during solidification


###### − Rapid cooling can lead to an amorphous ("shapeless") structure in which the atoms are not arranged in a regular pattern

 − In the best case (stable glass), the distances are sufficient to form a random network based on covalent bonds

###### In casting processes, however, crystalline structures are almost always present.

 This is due to the cooling rates that can be achieved in practice and the alloy composition of conventional metallic materials.


-----

###### Single crystal Polycrystal

 − The fundamental difference between monocrystalline (single crystal), polycrystalline and amorphous solids is the length scale over which the atoms are connected in a regularity (→ "periodicity" or "long-range order")

 − Single crystals have infinite periodicity, polycrystals have local periodicity, and amorphous solids (and liquids) have no long-range order


**Ideal single crystal:**

− Atomic structure that repeats

**periodically throughout its volume**

**Source: University of Cambridge Dissemination of IT**


**Polycrystal:**

− Composition of many individual grains or

**crystallites**

− Each grain can be considered as a single

crystal in which the atomic structure exhibits
long-range order

− On a sufficiently large length scale, no

**periodicity in a polycrystalline sample**


**Amorphous materials:**

− **No long-range order at all**
− The distances between the atoms in the

structure are precisely defined and are
similar to those in the crystal (long-range
order but only in crystals)


-----

###### Lattice defect | Polycrystal

 Lattice defect

 − A real crystal contains lattice defects → the three-dimensional periodic arrangement of the atoms is disturbed

 − Differentiation with regard to point errors, line errors, area errors and volume errors

 − As a rule, a crystalline solid is present as a polycrystal → Body consists of many small crystals that are separated from each other by grain boundaries

 − If different types of crystals are present next to each other → Phase boundaries

## Chapter 1.3: Speed of transformations


-----

###### Transformation rate/precipitation rate dW/dt

 Crystallization is the combined process of nucleation and growth that transforms a liquid into a crystalline solid.

 The transformation rate/precipitation rate dW/dt depends on how many nuclei have formed and the speed at which the phase interfaces move:

 Eq. 1.3.1

###### Example of crystallization:


-----

###### Influencing factors on the speed of phase transformation

 Temperature gradients − Drives the movement of phase boundaries as different parts of the material gain or lose energy at different rates; a higher temperature gradient often results in faster movement of the phase interface towards the warmer region

 Concentration gradients − Non-uniform distribution of particles; the diffusion of particles from higher to lower concentration increases the randomness (entropy) of the system
 − This diffusion often influences the movement of phase interfaces, as the system moves toward a more entropically favorable uniform distribution

 Surface tensions − Energy associated with the interface between phases; differences in surface tension influence the shape and stability of the phase interfaces
 − Lower surface tension can lead to more rapid changes in the phase interface

mixed (disordered) state of a two-component system

###### Influencing factors on the speed of phase transformation – Surface tensions

 − Equation for calculating Gibbs free energy:


###### Eq. 1.3.2


###### − Typical values for the surface tensions (γ) of technically relevant metals are in the range between 0.2 and 2 J/m² [SIN16]

 − Lower value for the surface tension: lower Gibbs Energy, lower critical radius → higher probability for nucleation

various test conditions: 0,626 .. 0,95 J/m² according to [1]

###### Driving force term increases

###### Mobility term decreases with increasing undercooling


###### Nucleation Nucleation growth

 − At melting temperature TM, there is no thermodynamic driving force for nucleation→ nucleation rate is zero

 − If the temperature decreases, -ΔGk becomes an increasingly large negative number and ΔG decreases, so that the concentration of nuclei of critical size increases

 − At the same time, however, the frequency of addition of atoms or molecules to the critical nucleus decreases

 − These competing effects lead to a peak in the nucleation rate at a

###### Heterogeneous nucleation

 − Please note: ΔGk is not a constant but depends on the temperature

 − Similar process in heterogeneous TTME Gleichgewichts-Schmelztemperatur nucleation; however, the crystallization nucleus is formed on a solid surface, e.g., on a mold wall or an impurity particle in the melt

 − Heterogeneous nucleation takes place on favorable surfaces, i.e., those with low interfacial energy to the crystal nucleus → the energetic disadvantage for the formation of the new interface decreases

 − The barrier ΔG for heterogeneous nucleation is therefore significantly lower → peak value of the nucleation rate shifts closer to the melting point

###### Transformation rates

 − Nucleation is followed by crystal growth: process of adding atoms or molecules to a crystal

 − Specification of the crystal growth rate U as (linear) speed at the interface between crystal and melt

 − Structure and chemistry of the crystallizing material define the properties of the growth processes (→ microstructural properties, microstructural morphology)

 − Crystal growth rate generally follows the schematic diagram shown: velocity increases steeply when the temperature drops below TM, reflecting the thermodynamic driving force for the phase change

 − The decreasing growth is due to slower diffusion at lower temperatures

-----

###### Effects on the resulting microstructure

 − High undercooling: inverse process: Activation energy QD of diffusion >> nucleation energy ΔGk → inhibits the formation of a nucleus

 − With increasing undercooling, not enough particles come together to form a nucleus and cause it to grow

 − Less diffusion:

 ➢ in the melt,

 ➢ across the phase boundaries,

 ➢ within the nucleus

 − Excessive undercooling can completely suppress nucleation → solidification of the undercooled melt without crystallization

 − Particles are "frozen" before they could have combined to form a crystal structure → amorphous materials (e.g., metallic glasses)

###### Heterogeneous nucleation

 − Consequently, a maximum nucleation rate at a defined undercooling, high probability of nucleation → fine-grained microstructure

 − Sufficiently high undercooling is therefore generally desirable, as this leads to a fine-grained microstructure → good strength properties of the microstructure

 − Heterogeneous nucleation also has a positive influence on the nucleation rate:


S = 0,1

S = 0,9


-----

###### Comparison of different undercoolings

 − Assumed homogeneous temperature distribution → uniform undercooling; preferred nucleation at the boundary due to the surrounding mold (higher probability of nucleation due to wetting on the mold wall)

 High undercooling: high probability of nucleation, low crystal growth rate due to limited diffusion → high number of small crystals, no complete solidification for a given time interval

 Moderate undercooling: lower probability of nucleation, higher crystal growth rate due to increased diffusion → smaller number of crystals but faster crystal growth → full solidification for a given time interval

 Limited undercooling: low probability of nucleation, high crystal growth rate – cannot compensate low probability of nucleation however → no complete solidification for a given time interval

###### Mold Casting Mold


###### Boundary Layer

 − Typically, only the metal touching the mold's surface cools below its equilibrium freezing temperature, forming a fine-grained structure as numerous crystals emerge and solidify swiftly

 The key question is how solidification progresses into the melt – this requires heat removal through the solid layer, lowering the freezing front's temperature below equilibrium:

 Columnar Zone

 − Further away from the mold wall, a slower cooling rate enables the development of elongated, columnar grains that grow perpendicular to the mold due to the steeper temperature gradient

 Equiaxed Zone

 − Central to the casting, the slowest cooling occurs, enabling uniform grain growth in all directions, producing isotropic, equiaxed grains due to a gentler temperature gradient


-----

###### Consideration of concentration differences – Constitutional undercooling

 − The assumption of complete mixing in the melt cannot be maintained, as there is usually no sufficiently high convection of the melt to reduce the resulting concentration gradients

 − Concentration gradients occur in the immediate vicinity of the nuclei or the growing grains

###### Constitutional undercooling

 − Different solubilities of the individual alloying elements of an alloy

 − The components that are less soluble in the solid phase are rejected at the liquid/solid phase boundary and diffuse back into the melt

 − In the melt: Accumulation of the components that are less soluble in the solid in front of the phase boundary (micro-segregation):

 ➢ Increase in the concentration

 ➢ Lowering of the local equilibrium liquidus temperature

 ➢ Temperature falls locally below the liquidus temperature
 despite an increasing temperature gradient

 − At the solidification front: concentration increase by ΔC0 of the dissolved component to C0/k
 − Exponential drop in concentration in the melt to CL = C0

###### Constitutional undercooling – Different solidification morphologies

 A
 − Three different solidification morphologies in metals and their associated temperature gradients during the solidification process due to effective undercooling from segregation of alloying elements, lowering the liquid's melting

 − Transition of growth morphology from planar, to cellular, to dendritic, as constitutional undercooling increases

 B
 − Morphologies influence the mechanical properties of the metal

 − Plane growth typically leads to fewer defects and can result in a stronger, more ductile metal

 − Cell and dendrite growth can lead to segregation of alloying elements and porosity, which can weaken the metal

###### Constitutional undercooling – Different solidification morphologies

 Plane Growth:

 − Simplest form of solidification, where the solid/liquid interface is flat; temperature in the solid is uniform and just below the melting point (Tmp)

 − Mold is at a lower temperature than the melt → nucleation occurs preferentially at the mold surface

 − As heat is extracted into the mold, the metal cools progressively away from the mold surface → solidification front advances uniformly into the liquid

 − As the cooling rate increases or the composition changes, the solid/liquid interface becomes unstable, leading to the formation of cells

 − Cells are polygonal at the front view and elongated at the side view

 − Temperature gradient at the interface indicates that the solid is slightly below the melting point at the cell boundaries and closer to the melting point within the cells

###### Dendrite Growth:

 − Existing non-uniform distribution of solute during solidification (concentration difference), leading to a constitutional undercooling ahead of the solid/liquid interface

 − The temperature gradient is steeper, with a larger undercooled region in the liquid ahead of the interface, which promotes dendritic growth (accelerating the solid's advance)

 − At even higher cooling rates or under certain alloy conditions, the cells become unstable and branch out, forming tree-like structures, called dendrites (Greek 'Dendros' for tree)

###### Competition in crystal growth

 − Different growth rates of grains in different spatial directions due to the stochastic orientation of the nuclei from which they originated

 − Grains always grow first along their main axes, as this causes the smallest surface enlargement

 − The solidification front always moves in the direction of the highest temperature gradient

 − The grains whose main axes point in the direction of the temperature gradient overgrow the grains with a less favorable orientation

## Chapter 1.5: Melt rheology


-----

###### Outline

 Process step: Mold filling


###### The flow behavior of the melt determines how it fills the mold: a proper understanding of the melt's rheology can help in predicting and controlling the mold filling process; this is essential to ensure complete filling of the mold

 Wetting behavior: The melt's interaction with the mold walls (wetting behavior) can affect the quality of the final product; good wetting ensures a smooth surface finish and reduces defects

 Solidification: As the melt cools and solidifies, its rheological properties change; understanding this transition helps in controlling the solidification rate and ensuring a uniform microstructure in the final product

 Aim: Defects avoidance


###### Many casting defects, such as air entrapment, cold shuts, and weld lines, are influenced by the flow behavior of the melt; by understanding and controlling the rheology, these defects can be minimized

 Fields of action in casting technology: Finding optimal process ranges


###### Knowledge of melt rheology helps in setting optimal processing parameters like injection speed, pressure, and temperature, ensuring efficient and defect-free casting


-----

###### Basics

 − Viscosity: One of the primary properties studied in melt rheology is viscosity, which is a measure of a fluid's resistance to shear or flow

 − The viscosity of molten materials can change with temperature, shear rate and time

 Newton’s Law of Viscosity:

 Eq. 1.5.1

###### Solids respond to a constantly applied shear force with a finite amount of deformation

 Deformation induced by a finite amount of deformation


-----

###### Viscosity of gases – Basics

 Gases

 − Molecules are widely spaced and move randomly at high speed

 − Viscosity in gases is due to the transfer of momentum between fast- moving molecules when they collide with each other

 − As gas molecules are farther apart, they have a mean free path (the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule), which increases with temperature

 − As temperature increases, gas viscosity increases because the molecules move faster and collide more energetically, leading to greater momentum transfer


###### The efficient engineer, https://youtu.be/VvDJyhYSJv8


###### Intermolecular collisions are dominating the influence on viscosity


-----

###### Viscosity of gases

 − Viscosity of gases increase with temperature due to more frequent and energetic molecular collisions

 − Sutherland's Law provides a temperature-dependent model for gas viscosity:


-----

###### Viscosity of fluids – Basics

 Fluids

 − The molecules are closer together and interact more frequently

 − Viscosity in liquids is due to the attractive forces between closely packed molecules, which resist movement past each other

 − Unlike gases, increasing temperature in liquids typically reduces viscosity because the increased molecular motion overcomes the intermolecular forces

 − As temperature increases, liquid viscosity usually decreases because the higher thermal energy allows molecules to overcome the attractive forces that keep them in place


###### The efficient engineer, https://youtu.be/VvDJyhYSJv8


###### Intermolecular cohesive forces are dominating the influence on viscosity


-----

###### Viscosity of fluids

 − For liquids, as the temperature increases, the viscosity typically decreases

 − Increased temperature generally increases the energy of the liquid molecules, which then can more easily overcome intermolecular forces, allowing them to move more freely past one another

 − Simulation of casting processes demands accurate information on thermophysical properties for selected alloys; this is particularly relevant for multi-component alloys

 − Several models can be found in the literature, such as those in the form of Arrhenius-type equations; models still depend on the availability of experimental data

 − A considerable discrepancy between experimental data and simulated results is frequently observed for some pure metals

prediction of temperature-dependent viscosity of multicomponent
liquid alloys Continuum Mech Thermodyn 31 pp 1369 1385


-----

###### Viscosity of fluids

 − Like all thermally activated processes, the temperature dependence of viscosity for liquids can be expressed by a relationship similar to the Arrhenius equation, also known as the Andrade equation:

 Eq. 1.5.7

 − Andrade equation underestimates the temperature dependence of viscosity

 − Andrade equation as well as other, much more complex but also more precise models, require the specification of experimentally determined, material-specific constants



**[DIN04]**


-----

###### Basics

 − Definition of the Reynolds number, influence of the viscosity term in the denominator on the Reynolds number:

 Eq. 1.5.8

 − High viscosity → laminar flow (low Reynolds number)

 − Let us illustrate this using the example of the viscosity of Flower Honey (Blended)

 − Temperature dependent data from Anton Paar: https://wiki.anton-paar.com/en/flower-honey-blended/


###### Viscosity of Flower Honey (Blended)


-----

###### Basics

 − As introduced before:

 Eq. 1.5. 4

 − For a Newtonian fluid, the relationship between shear stress and strain rate is linear and can be described by Newton's law of viscosity (Eq. 1.5.1)

 − For shear thinning (pseudoplastic) and shear thickening (dilatant) fluids, the relationship is not linear

 − Shear thinning fluids exhibit a decrease in viscosity with increasing strain rate; shear thickening fluids show an increase in viscosity


-----

###### Influence of solidification on the flow

 The homogenization processes caused by the flow also have an effect on the flow behavior of the molten metal by changing the solidification morphology

 − With increasing flow, “smoother” spherical grains are formed instead of “rough” dendritic grains

 − The smoother the surface, the lower the flow resistance of the grains, i.e., the viscosity of the molten metal decreases with the smoothness of the surface of the grains present

 − The viscosity of molten metal depends on the flow-related solidification front of the grains

 → The viscosity of molten metals is therefore dependent on shear rate and time (= thixotropic)

 Schematic 2D flow diagram of grains with different morphologies


-----

###### Definition of thixotropic behavior

 − While the viscosity of Newtonian media changes neither with time nor with the shear rate, the viscosities of shear-thinning and shear-strengthening media change directly with the shear rate, independent of time

 − The viscosity of a thixotropic material depends on the shear rate and time



###### ▪ During constant shear stress, the viscosity of the thixotropic medium decreases with time

 ▪ After the end of the shear stress, the viscosity of the thixotropic medium increases again over time to the initial level


-----

###### Definition of thixotropic behavior

 As explained above, the surface of the grains changes due to the change in concentration of the melt surrounding them and the resulting change in the solidification front

 Procedure:

 − During constant shear stress, the concentration build-up around the grains is increasingly reduced and the dendrite tips are melted

 − After the end of the shear stress, the concentration build-up around the grains increases again due to the lack of mixing


-----

###### Metal flow in narrow areas

 − Typical Behavior: Most pure liquid metals, such as aluminum, exhibit Newtonian behavior where viscosity is constant, regardless of the shear rate

 − Non-Newtonian Exceptions: In special cases, such as during high-shear processing or when metals are in a semi-solid state, non-Newtonian behaviors like shear thinning can occur

 − In Metal Processing (High-Speed Casting): Shear thinning can enhance metal flow into molds, reducing casting defects

 − Predominantly Newtonian: Despite these exceptions, pure liquid metals like aluminum usually maintain Newtonian characteristics under most processing conditions

 − Semi-Solid Metal Processing: In processes such as thixomolding and thixocasting, where metal is partially solid, shear thinning is more pronounced due to the interaction between solid and liquid phases

###### Fluidity Tests in Casting

 Objective

 − Fluidity tests measure the ability of a molten metal to fill intricate features of a mold before solidifying

 Importance in Casting Technology

 − Determines Quality: High fluidity ensures the casting can replicate detailed designs without defects

 − Material Characterization: Fluidity varies among metals and alloys and depends on composition, temperature and ambient conditions

 Test Methods

 − Spiral Mold Test: A classic method where the metal is poured into a spiral cavity; the distance it travels before solidifying is measured as fluidity

 − Flow Test: Molten metal is poured to fill a standardized thin section pattern until it stops flowing, assessing its fill capacity

###### Fluidity Tests in Casting

 General factors that influence fluidity

 − Temperature: Higher than the melting point increases fluidity; overheating can lead to gas absorption and oxidation

 − Viscosity: Low viscosity metals flow better; additives and impurities can alter viscosity

 − Mold Design: Smooth, coated molds improve flow; complex shapes can reduce fluidity

 − Atmosphere: Protective gases can reduce surface tension and improve flow

 Observations

 − Effect of Superheat: At 0°C superheat, fluidity is relatively low across all tin percentages; increasing superheat significantly enhances fluidity due to reduced viscosity and delayed solidification

 − Alloy composition: As tin is added to aluminum, it forms a series of intermetallic compounds; these compounds can disrupt the liquid structure, increase viscosity, and hence, reduce fluidity

-----

###### Fluidity Tests in Casting

 Material properties that influence fluidity

 − Composition effect: Tin addition forms intermetallic compounds, raising viscosity and reducing fluidity

 − Superheat influence: Higher superheating generally enhances fluidity, but fluidity still drops with more tin at all superheat levels

 − Solidification impact: More tin widens the solidification range, causing early solid particle formation that impedes flow

 − Eutectic behavior: Initial tin additions lower melting point up to eutectic composition; beyond this, higher-melting phases decrease fluidity

 − Surface tension and wetting: Changes in alloy composition affect surface tension and mold wetting, crucial for flow into mold details

###### Fluidity Tests in Casting

 Fluidity at zero-superheat

 Eutectic Point: Additives lower the melting point up to the eutectic concentration, beyond which higher-melting intermetallics form, affecting fluidity

 Solidification Range: Alloys with compositions away from the eutectic point have an extended solidification range, which can hinder fluidity as early solidification occurs

 Phase Formation: Non-eutectic compositions promote the formation of primary phases before reaching the eutectic, increasing viscosity and reducing fluidity

## Chapter 2.1: Sand casting


-----

###### Process description

 − The melt is poured into the pouring basin or cup

 − The melt flows down the sprue, through the gating system including gates and runners.

 − It then enters the riser and mold cavity, which has a core for internal features.

 − Vents in the mold allow air to exit effectively during filling.

 − A filter within the mold captures inclusions in the melt.

 − As solidification occurs, the riser feeds the mold cavity to counteract solidification shrinkage

 − Fabricate core box (3), then use it to create the core in two sand pieces

 − Compact sand mix in the flask around the cope pattern, often with inserts for the sprue, pouring cup, and sometimes a riser, remove pattern and inserts (4)

###### Casting filters

 − Used to retain inclusions like slag, foam, or oxides from melt flow in gate systems

 − Help homogenize and decelerate metal flow, reducing re-oxidation and sand erosion risk

 − Ceramic filters are common, differentiated into ceramic foam (pore structure from foaming) and cellular ceramics (pore structure from pressing)

 − Filter materials include zirconium silicate, zirconium oxide, silicon carbide, and mullite

 − Thicker filters increase flow resistance, affecting mold filling time and casting quality

 − Filter size selection depends on casting temperature, pore size, and impurities in the molten metal

 − Accumulated impurities increase filter flow resistance, possibly leading to a stall

 − In larger castings, using multiple filters across several casting processes is advantageous


-----

###### Different types of casting filters

 Pressed Filters

 + High reproducibility due to manufacturing method, ensuring consistent characteristics; strong, can withstand high flows; suitable for large castings

 − Risk of non-laminar flow after filtering, unlike foam filters; creates small streams of metal

 Foam Filters

 + Effective in filtering the melt and creating laminar flow

 − Low reproducibility between and within manufacturers and batches due to manufacturing method; challenging for large castings due to potential breakage and scalability issues

 Woven Filters

 + Easy to apply and inexpensive

 − Only filters large particles; not effective in reducing the speed of the flow

###### Simulation of fluid flow using casting filters

 − Real dimensions in casting filters allow for accurate simulations of pressure drop and friction without estimating values

 − It's critical to use the correct dimensions and filter materials to achieve the desired speed, pressure loss, and temperature drop

 − Accurate simulation helps determine if the initial melt can successfully penetrate the filter, addressing a common issue

 − The image sequence shows a foam filter's cross-section being heated during filling, mimicking real-life conditions

 − Simulation of pressed and foam filters can be done using Finite Volume Method (FVM); increase of modelling and calculation efforts

###### Ladles for molten metal transfer

 − Final adjustments to temperature and composition of the melt are made in the ladle, which can be automated

 − Bottom pouring ladles are advantageous as they pull metal from below the surface, reducing inclusion of slag

 − Melt streams from ladles can be shrouded to reduce oxygen exposure, essential for reactive metals like magnesium alloys

 − Mold filling uses gravity to direct the melt through design features, preventing air entrainment and minimizing turbulence

###### Required binders

 − Function of binders: Binders in sand casting ensure sand grains adhere together to form molds and cores, affecting the casting's finish and integrity

 − Traditional clay binders: Clay, specifically Bentonite, offers good mold strength but can introduce gas defects due to moisture, known as green sand casting (→ inorganic binders)

 − Resin systems: Chemical systems, like phenolic urethanes, are activated with catalysts (heat or chemicals) and vary in efficacy with different alloys (→ organic binders)

 − Choice between green and resin sand casting


-----

###### Required binders

 Common types of organic binders include

 − Phenolic resins: Thermosetting plastics that become irreversibly hardened upon heating

 − Furan resins: Made from furfuryl alcohol, these resins are known for their thermal resistance and mechanical strength

 − Urethane resins: Offer excellent binding properties and flexibility

 + A significant advancement, providing stronger molds with resins activated by heat or chemicals, allowing for finer details and superior finishes

 + Lower moisture content

 − Resin systems may require longer curing times, impacting productivity

 − Stronger molds/core structures may complicate shakeout processes

 − Cost variations exist among different resins and catalysts

 − Potential environmental concerns due to the emissions of volatile

-----

###### Characteristic advantages / disadvantages of sand casting processes

 Advantages

 + Cost-effective for small batches: The tooling and setup costs for sand casting are generally lower compared to other casting methods, making it cost-effective for small production runs

 + Complex geometries: Sand casting can produce complex shapes that would be difficult or impossible with other casting methods

 + Large part capability: It is capable of casting very large components that might not be possible with other types of casting processes due to equipment size limitations

 + Wide material choice: Sand casting allows for a wide variety of metals to be used, including ferrous and non-ferrous alloys

 + Tooling flexibility: Modifications to the mold are relatively easy to make and at a low cost

 Disadvantages

 − Surface finish and tolerance: Generally, produces a rougher surface finish compared to other methods, and the dimensional tolerances are not as tight

 − Labor intensive: The process can be more labor-intensive compared to automated casting processes

 − Porosity: There is a higher likelihood of porosity in sand castings, which can affect the mechanical properties of the cast part

 − Mold deterioration: Since the mold is made of sand, it can deteriorate during the pouring of the molten metal, potentially leading to defects in the casting

 − Environmental concerns: Disposal of used sand can be an environmental concern, and the sand can sometimes contain harmful materials that require careful handling

 − Slow production rate: Sand casting generally has a slower production rate compared to die casting or investment casting, making it less


-----

## Chapter 2.2: Investment casting


-----

###### Process description


###### − Wax Model Production: Manufacturing of the wax model in a specially machined mold

 − Wax Model Assembly: The wax model is usually manually assembled with other wax parts to form so-called wax trees.

 − Ceramic Dipping: The assembled wax trees are dipped in a ceramic slurry and then coated with sand. This creates a ceramic shell around the wax, which serves as the casting mold

 − Burnout and Sintering: Burning/melting out the wax trees from the ceramic shell and sintering the ceramic. This process creates the necessary mold stability

 − Casting: The metal is poured into the still hot, wax-free mold

 − Cleaning and Separation: Removal of the ceramic shell, separation of the supply channels, and completion of the casting parts

###### Process description

 − Metal or ceramic cores are used, considering the mold’s ability to open and close

 − Permanent molds are created through machining and require vents due to non-permeable materials

 − Ejector pins may be present to assist in part removal

 − Higher thermal conductivity of the molds leads to increased heat transfer rates and shorter solidification times

 − Heat conduction through the metal casting, not the mold, limits the solidification rate, assuming constant temperatures for the metal melt and the mold

 − Gravitational Pouring: Utilizes gravity to fill the mold; the simplest and most common method

 − Vacuum Casting: Uses a vacuum to draw molten metal into the mold; beneficial for reducing turbulence and entrapped gases.

 − (Low-)Pressure Casting: Applies pressure to push the metal into the mold, allowing for faster filling and finer detail capture

 − Tilt Pouring: Involves tilting the mold to gradually fill it, minimizing turbulence and air entrapment

 − Limited to lower melting point, nonferrous alloys such as aluminum, magnesium, copper, and zinc

 Die Casting Process Types:

 − Hot Chamber Die Casting (a): Features an integrated melt reservoir and gooseneck system for metal injection.

###### Characteristic filling properties in the casting chamber

 − Due to the high temperature difference between the chamber wall and the melt, solidification processes (pre-solidification) occur in the casting chamber

 − These pre-solidified areas cause disturbances in the melt flow and bonding errors during mold filling, leading to dynamic differences from the melt → quality defects

 − In contrast to plastic melts, the surfaces (flow fronts) of metal melts are significantly more unstable or volatile

 − The fluid dynamic design of the casting system, as well as the casting parameters (e.g., mold filling speeds), are therefore of high importance, as they can cause unstable flow fronts, air entrapment, etc.

 − Unstable flow fronts in metal casting are often due to the high fluidity and temperatures involved, necessitating precise control over the casting parameters to ensure quality

 − Techniques like computer simulation of fluid dynamics are often employed to predict and mitigate these issues before actual production

## Chapter 3.2: Shrinkage during solidification


-----

###### Shrinkage during solidification

 Definition: Shrinkage refers to the reduction in volume as a material transitions from liquid to solid during cooling.

 Types of Shrinkage/Contraction:

 − Liquid Shrinkage: Occurs as the metal cools from pouring temperature to solidification temperature

 − Solidification Shrinkage: Happens when the metal changes from liquid to solid phase

 − Solid Shrinkage: The volume reduction during cooling of solid metal to room temperature

 Implications:

 − Mold Design: Molds must account for shrinkage to maintain dimensional accuracy

 − Risers: Used to compensate for shrinkage by supplying additional liquid metal

 − Alloy Selection: Different alloys exhibit different shrinkage rates

 − Defects!

###### Shrinkage during solidification


###### Key Concept: During solidification, liquids typically contract due to atomic rearrangement from a ‘random close-packed’ structure to a denser crystalline structure

 Solid Density and Contraction:

 − Close-Packed Metals (fcc & hcp): Exhibit the highest contraction on solidification, ranging from 3.2–7.2%

 − Less Close-Packed Metals (bcc): Experience moderate solidification shrinkage between 2–3.2%

 − Other Materials: Less dense solids may contract less or even expand upon freezing

 Expansive Materials: Water, silicon, and bismuth are known to expand on freezing.

 Cast Iron: An important alloy that also expands on solidification (graphite formation tends to occupy more volume than the liquid iron from which it precipitates; eutectic reaction) fcc = face centered cubic
**hex bzw hcp = hexagonal close packed**

 Feeding Mechanisms & Porosity:

 − Pressure gradients drive feeding mechanisms, reducing porosity

 − Feeding vs. pore formation depends on the presence of nuclei

 − Clean metal without nuclei will continue feeding until fully solid, avoiding porosity

 Shrinkage Porosity Consequences:

 − Even small contractions in size can lead to significant internal cavities

 − For most cast materials, shrinkage porosity is a major threat to integrity

###### 5.


###### Understanding Material Properties: − Choose suitable casting materials based on mechanical properties, melting temperature, and solidification behavior

 Design for Manufacturability: − Simplify geometry to minimize undercuts and complex features
 − Ensure uniform wall thickness to prevent hotspots and reduce shrinkage defects

 Incorporating Draft Angles: − Include draft angles in vertical surfaces to facilitate easy removal from molds

 Mold Considerations: − Design molds to compensate for metal shrinkage and cooling contractions.
 − Use risers and gating systems to ensure proper metal flow and solidification

 Allowance for Machining and Finishing: − Provide additional material for post-casting machining processes
 − Anticipate surface finish requirements and dimensional tolerances

###### Avoiding Stress Concentrations: − Radius internal corners and fillets to reduce stress concentration
 − Avoid sudden changes in cross-sectional areas

 Design for Soundness: − Position internal cavities to minimize trapped gases and shrinkage porosity
 − Use cores effectively to create hollow sections and reduce weight

 Thermal Management in Design: − Analyze heat flow to manage cooling rates and solidification patterns
 − Design for directional solidification from the thinnest to the thickest section

 Feeding and Risers: − Design feeding paths to deliver molten metal to all regions during solidification
 − Size and place risers to compensate for shrinkage without causing discontinuities

 Quality Assurance: − Implement a robust inspection plan for critical dimensions and defects
 − Use simulation tools to predict and address potential casting issues during design


-----

###### Design for Manufacturability

 2. Reducing material concentrations in casting designs is vital for several reasons:

 − Even Cooling and Solidification: Thick sections cool slower, leading to uneven solidification. This can cause internal stresses, distortion, and cracking

 − Minimize Shrinkage Defects: Thick areas are prone to shrinkage cavities as they remain molten longer and may not be adequately fed by the risers

 − Material Efficiency: Reducing material concentrations leads to more efficient use of material, reducing weight and cost

 Design Strategies:

 − Strive for uniformity in wall thickness to ensure consistent cooling rates

 − Coring Out Large Sections: Replace large solid areas with hollow sections or use cores to maintain strength while reducing mass

###### Avoiding Stress Concentrations

 6. Sharp edges in casting design are prone to defects and weaknesses due to the following reasons:

 − Stress Concentration (mold and casting): Sharp edges create points of high stress concentration, leading to cracks and failure under load

 − Flow Disruption: During casting, molten metal flow can be turbulent around sharp edges, leading to incomplete filling or cold shuts

 − Cooling Irregularities: Sharp corners cool faster than the rest of the material, causing differential shrinkage and residual stress

 Critical in all types of casting processes, particularly where mechanical strength and reliability are paramount

 Design Solutions: Incorporate Fillets and Radii – use smooth curves instead of sharp transitions; fillets (rounded internal corners) and radii (rounded external corners) reduce stress concentration

###### Thermal Management in Design

 8. Concept: Controlled solidification of molten metal from one end of the mold to the other

 Purpose:

 − Minimizes defects like shrinkage cavities and porosity

 − Ensures a uniform and fine grain structure

 Process and design strategy:

 − Begins at the coolest part of the mold (usually near the mold walls); progresses towards the risers, which stay molten longer to feed the solidifying metal

 − Mold and casting design should facilitate a steady, unidirectional flow of heat

 − Risers and chills are strategically placed to control cooling rates and solidification path
